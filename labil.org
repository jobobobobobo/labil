#+TITLE: Labil Design Document

* Preface
** Motivations
Leafwing Ability System is a little undercooked, and projectharmonia already made a wonderful little input crate based on enhanced input system for unreal, so I want to port GAS to rust and maybe get it looking more ergonomic.
** Gameplay Ability System
GAS is an unreal engine plugin that handles abilities and attributes for game characters. It is very powerful but very awkward.
** Artillery
Artillery is the project associated with Bristlecone, which I'm implementing for =aeronet=, and it has a lot of perf advantages over GAS. Server compute will always be at a premium, so I want to make sure I'm just *sipping* power whenever possible.
** Leafwing Ability System
An existing rust ability system.
